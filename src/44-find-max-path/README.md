Given a board, a two-dimensional array of integers, find the path of four adjacent integers that yields the largest total integer.

Integers are considered adjacent if they share a full side.

Example:
Board = [
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]
] // 9874

Example 2:
Board = [0,1,4,0,0] // 1400

Example 3:
Board = [0,1,4,5,0] // 5410
