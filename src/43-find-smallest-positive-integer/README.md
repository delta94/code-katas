Write a function that, given an array of integers, returns the smallest positive integer that does not occur in the array.

Examples:
- Given Arr = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
- Given Arr = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
- Given Arr = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
